  to access additional features and services, including the ability to 
  communicate with other members, HelloPulse reserves the right to charge 
  for these services. Please see our billing details for a description 
  of the current rates. This rate list is part of this Agreement. We can 
  change the fees for the Service at any time but we will give you reasonable
