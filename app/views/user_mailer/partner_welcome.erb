Hello!

Great to have you on board as a partner with HelloPulse – the site that enables like-minded single people to connect out and about in the city they live.

The idea behind HelloPulse is that you get a better insight into what someone is like based on where they go and what they do than by reading a profile where everyone tends to sound the same. We also know that you’re more likely to meet someone when you’re out living your life rather than sitting behind a computer.

HelloPulse members have already told us they socialise at your venue, so as a partner you now have a direct communication line with our highly attractive and influential customer demographic.

You now have a dedicated partner page on HelloPulse where you can post updates to our members and include a link to your Facebook fan page or website.  We will also notify all our members when anyone adds your venue to their profile and broadcast this on both Facebook and Twitter.

We look forward to continuing to build this relationship and helping to promote your venue to our members.

Please email us at admin@hellopulse.com if you have any questions or feedback. We’re constantly updating the site so can’t wait to show you what’s new.
