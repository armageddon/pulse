    Hello! 
 
    Thanks so much for checking out HelloPulse – the next generation site for bringing like-minded single people together.  We’re currently testing the site and really appreciate your feedback.   
 
    The idea behind HelloPulse is that you get a better insight into what someone is like based on where they go and what they do than you do than by reading a profile where everyone tends to sound the same.  We also know that you’re more likely to meet someone when you’re out living your life rather than sitting behind a computer.  That’s why HelloPulse helps you connect in the real world.  Just tell us where to go to meet great single people.  
 
    Please let us know your thoughts on the feedback form at the bottom of the page.  We’re constantly updating the site so can’t wait to show you what’s new. 
 
    Happy searching. 
 
    The HelloPulse Team
